This buzzer system was created in C++ using an Arduino Mega. There is a central control panel and 6 buzzers. When a button is pressed, the LEDs on that button and on the control panel activate and a noise emits from the control panel. These LEDs stay active, and no one else can buzz, until the reset button is pressed on the central control panel. The video attachment shows the buzzer system without the lid to the central control panel attached.
