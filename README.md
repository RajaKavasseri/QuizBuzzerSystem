# QuizBuzzerSystem
This is a buzzer system for 2 teams of 3 people. It can also be used for individual play for up to 6 people. The buzzer system emits sound and lights up when one person buzzes, and no one else can buzz until the moderator of the game clears the initial buzz. Then, everyone is able to buzz again.
